### Nearbuy ###

This is an uncompleted project developed in _Ruby on Rails_. The idea of the
project was to create a system for small businesses to advertise their stores
and products. A companion Android application would allow users to find these
stores using Google Maps, the purpose being that small stores that may be 
overlooked would attract more business.
